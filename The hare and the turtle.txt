In the world of the animals, there was a very arrogant hare because she said to everyone she was the fastest. That’s why she was always laughing at the slow turtle.
-Look at the turtle! Hey turtle, don’t run so much that you’re going to get tired of going so fast!- The hare used to say laughing at the turtle.
One day, they were talking and it occurred to the turtle to make a strange bet with the hare.
-I’m sure I can win you a race- she said.
- To me?- asked the hare astonished.
